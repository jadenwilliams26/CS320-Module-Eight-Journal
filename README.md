In order to ensure my code is functional and secure, testing is the only option. Throughout this course I have found that by leaving bias at the door and properly testing my code, I will find and fix errors much quicker. <br/><br/>
Users don't often know how to articulate their needs properly, or they may not know how to speak code so interpreting a users needs is an important skill to have. In a previous course I was able to take on the role of a Product Owner and learned how to interpret user requirements and turn them into User Stories for the backlog. This new found skill of interpreting user requirements has helped me immensly in figuring out how to incorporate them into the program. <br/><br/>
When I approach designing software, I enter a very curious and intuitive mindset. By being curious and intuitive I ask the right questions to gain deeper insight into what the project is. By asking clarifying or deeper questions, the client is able to express more about the project then they initially may have which can lead to a smoother development process.
